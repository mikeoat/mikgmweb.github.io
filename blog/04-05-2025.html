<h2>phone bad</h2>
<p>you heard it here first folks, social media bad and phone bad and convenience bad. i&#39;m not going to waste your time with why here, but there was a great <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-roundup-2025">indieweb carnival about friction</a> that you can check out if you&#39;d like to understand more about the general philosophy.
...
as i&#39;ve gotten further into my adult life, i&#39;ve realized that a lot of a person&#39;s success with building and breaking habits comes with how they design their usage of tools. many people allow tools to be designed for them -- there&#39;s nothing wrong with that at all. my personal preference is to try to make everything around me fit me as a person, but also help mold me into the person i want to be. this will always be a battle i am fighting, but that isn&#39;t such a bad thing in my mind. i enjoy trying to work some aspect of design into every part of my life.
anyways, lemme get to my point: using your brain makes it better. my impetus for writing this post came about when i was using the terminal to update my walker page. i realized after i got into the folder that i didn&#39;t need to list the files in the folder, i just knew what was in there. back when i used finder or file explorer primarily, i would simply read the contents of a given folder, since that&#39;s the most convenient option of information retrieval in that application. i didn&#39;t have to remember, i could just read. it resulted in me having &quot;file cleaning&quot; days where i would sit for several hours and go through all the files in various folders in order to free up space on my drive. as i use the terminal for file management more, those days move further and further behind me.</p>
<h2>further examples: youtube on jellyfin</h2>
<p>in addition to my file management skills, i think designing frictionful methods of doing things has improved my content consumption as well.
i am a zoomer (im not even old enough to drink in the US). my content consumption was similar to that of my generational peers: scrolling some kind of social media, getting addicted to moving by thumb a certain way repeatedly for hours. i recognized that my habits were NOT healthy AT ALL. i wanted a way to take back my agency from The Algorithm™, so i started downloading youtube videos directly to my <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">jellyfin server</a>. now, when i want to watch something, i have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>decide what to download (free of the algorithm. i only hear about videos from other people online or in person, which makes viewing the videos a lot more valuable)</li>
<li>download it (requires me to enter commands in my terminal and required me to set up a couple scripts)</li>
<li>rescan my jellyfin library (sounds hard but its a single button)</li>
</ol>
<p>now that i do it this way, i have to make a concerted effort to watch a youtube video. it&#39;s had the byproduct of making youtube channels feel like i&#39;m watching shows because there is an end to the content i can consume. my entire life, i&#39;ve had the sum of all human facts and falsehoods in my pocket everywhere i go. i still do, but now i go down more useful rabbit holes. i haven&#39;t blocked youtube on any of my devices. in fact, i just watched some slop yesterday! the primary thing that&#39;s changed is that i use it differently now. i type youtube.com in my browser with knowledge of what i want to watch before i get on the site.
...
in classic mike fashion, i want to call back to something i forgot to elaborate on earlier: channels feel like shows. because of this, unsurprisingly, i finally watch more shows. i&#39;m watching <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1pGAbqXFNk/maxresdefault.jpg">INVINCIBLE</a> right now and i&#39;m LOVING it. when my desires and thoughts are in MY brain and not being fed to me by an algorithm that desires and thinks for me, i enjoy the content i consume more simply due to my own agency.</p>
<h2>further examples: phone bad</h2>
<p>we call that a circle-back. my phone is in japanese (because i&#39;m learning before i go in july), heavily desaturated, devoid of notifications, and full of genuinely productive apps.
the fact that it&#39;s in a (mostly) unreadable language makes it difficult to use and makes me want to pick it up less. though, if i do pick it up, i trick myself into practicing reading japanese. by simply having my phone, i am always improving in some aspect instead of being hindered.
though a useful aspect of my phone usage, it&#39;s not enough to completely keep me off of it. that&#39;s why my home screen is completely black and white, and the rest of everything on my phone is heavily desaturated.</p>
<p>further than desaturation, i also don&#39;t have notifications for anything except my bank account and some 2FA apps. this ensures that i am not 100% reachable at all hours of the day, which gives me some privacy. it&#39;s very jarring whenever i&#39;m doing something else then my phone pings or buzzes and rips me out of whatever i&#39;m doing and MAKES me pay attention. i have control over where my attention is placed now. if i want to respond to texts, i physically open the app and respond to them. the only thing about doing this is that when i do spend time on my phone, i go through a routine of checking a couple apps, which i feel could be optimized with something like <a href="https://github.com/glanceapp/glance">glance</a>. i wonder if there&#39;s some sort of plugin that allows me to monitor everything i have at once so i look at my phone a single time then put it down.
unfortunately for me, this is an optimization problem to which i will cave so immediately.
...
finally, i only keep productive or otherwise helpful apps on my phone. you&#39;ll notice on my home screen, i have 16 apps and 3 widgets.
that&#39;s the only screen on my homepage.
that&#39;s (mostly) all i use.
i have a couple other apps that i hardly access, like tailscale, finamp, nhl, etc. it&#39;s really just more technical stuff that i don&#39;t use all the time. by having only a handful of apps on my home screen, i access them more. i&#39;m even contemplating just not having a browser on my phone since i&#39;d rather be spending time on the internet using my computer anyways. the reason i&#39;m contemplating it, though, is because of glance, which runs in a browser. ideally, i&#39;d have an android (first time that&#39;s been said) on which i can create my own app that accesses a single webpage using <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">electron</a> or something. my job right now has me using <a href="https://dart.dev/">dart</a>/<a href="https://flutter.dev/">flutter</a> which i don&#39;t hate like i do javascript (you have to cheer now because i said something based).</p>
<h2>conclusion andy</h2>
<p>i kind of got off on a tangent there because i&#39;m utterly insane, but my point is: as i use my brain more, i feel more agency in my decisions. this helps me feel more confident in who i am and what i do, frees up my time to blog (have you noticed i&#39;ve been posting more lately?), work on whatever the hell i want, and do the things i enjoy that i wished i could do when i was in the clutches of the algorithm.</p>
<p>i hope you got a different perspective from reading this. if you didn&#39;t that&#39;s okay too. if you have something you&#39;d like to say about it, feel free to leave a message on my guestbook or email me at <a href="mailto:micgmcd@proton.me">micgmcd@proton.me</a>. cya~</p>
