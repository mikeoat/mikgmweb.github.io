<p>better late than never!
...
this month was full of grindy stuff. not many new things to say, but i have a feeling next month is gonna go way harder. if you want an outline of how this is laid out and why, see my post for october. without further ado, lets get into it</p>
<p>social</p>
<p>my social life and all of its factors</p>
<p>aspirations</p>
<p>my journey with things that i try to do in my free time to help set myself up better for success</p>
<p>the grind</p>
<p>my current working life</p>
<h2>social</h2>
<p>november was an uninteresting month socially. i didn&#39;t really have too much time to hang out with friends because of various projects i had to work on for school, as well as some things that&#39;ll be outlined in the grind.</p>
<p>though few, i did hang out with a few friends here and there on various nights. one of the more notable ones was actually with my partner&#39;s friend. we organized our storage area with her then went out on the town, not before picking up her car since it got towed. i was pretty surprised because i didn&#39;t really expect that to happen, though it makes sense in retrospect considering she parked right near the path the towing company patrol truck (no idea what these guys are called) usually takes. all else aside, it was a nice reprieve from midterms.</p>
<p>one of my biggest goals for next year is to get more out of my friendships by making a conscious effort to do so. i&#39;m not that good at planning things out at the moment, but i hope to get better.</p>
<h2>aspirations</h2>
<p>the main thing i really had to worry about was a project in my mixing class where i had 4 weeks to do ALL of the audio for a scene from a movie. i chose the kung fu fight scene in the matrix. it ended up being pretty fun, though i wish i hadn&#39;t put it off &#39;til the last minute. i know i&#39;m not alone in that sentiment, since my classmates did the same thing, but i still don&#39;t think its a good idea for me to do that. a lot of my growth thus far has been breaking those habits to a certain extent. if i were assigned this project a year ago, i would&#39;ve waited until 3 days before it was do to start.</p>
<p>aside from that, i&#39;ve just been slowly chipping away at my sound design reel. i hope to apply to <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">riot games</a> at some point soon since they have a summer internship opportunity open at the moment. i plan to truly finish my reel while im alone in our apartment this month. you&#39;ll have to hear about how that goes in the next monthly post!</p>
<p>another thing that&#39;s been on my mind is whether or not i should take a gap semester this coming semester. i think it would be good to use that opportunity to work and save up a ton of money, given my position at saltie girl. i&#39;d also be able to take some time off of school to reflect on my own creativity a little, which has been troubling me lately. i find it difficult to get into the flow of things when i have a million different things going on.</p>
<p>my main argument for taking a gap is that i&#39;d be able to save up some rent money and not be working during the semester, which is what has been killing me lately. however, it feels like a pretty big decision. i&#39;m gonna talk it over with my closest people first. if you&#39;re reading this and you have my contact info, feel free to tell me what you think. i need all the input i can get.</p>
<h2>the grind</h2>
<p>as you can imagine based on the previous section, work has been giving me some cognitive trouble. i&#39;m currently training to become a server, but things are going slowly due to staff shortages. while upsetting, the situation is somewhat of a blessing because finals are soon approaching. i&#39;ve made more friends there as well, having improved my reputation somewhat (at least in my own head).
...
that&#39;s it! see you next month!</p>
