<p>i went to denver with my wonderful partner to meet up with her family for thanksgiving. it was a great time. my spanish has gotten markedly better than the last time i went. honestly i feel like the practice i&#39;ve gotten through my job is really one of the only good things it has brought me. spanish has given me a pretty rough go of it – rather i&#39;ve made it rough for myself by not practicing!!! it&#39;s nice to observe that hard work paying off.
...
aside from being immersed in the language, i was as immersed in her culture as i feel i&#39;ve been since we started dating. i loved every second of it. i think my further immersion is a result of both having established myself as her partner simply through the passage of time and also being able to communicate things a little better in her family&#39;s native language (i&#39;ll try to stop talking about languages now, i just get so excited!)
...
anyways, the trip was a lot of fun. we visited a few carnicerías and panaderías to great success. i wish i could find some butchers around boston to get more cuts of meat than what i&#39;m used to. she actually made pozole recently and we have some pig shoulder left over, so maybe i&#39;ll try to find a recipe for it and experiment.
...
a shorter post, but a helpful one nonetheless. it&#39;s nice to reflect on things that happen in my life because it puts into perspective just how grateful i am for certain things; in this case, having such an intimate relationship with someone outside my own culture. i truly value the perspective that i gain and the awesome things i learn. here&#39;s to another 9999999999999999999 years together!</p>
