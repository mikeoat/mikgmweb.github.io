<h2>writing</h2>
<p>sometimes i really do just feel like writing. i don&#39;t really feel like i have much to write about sometimes, particularly in this moment, but it&#39;s nice to have a place to do so.</p>
<h2>that&#39;s what i&#39;ll write about</h2>
<p>having a personal website and taking the time to beef it up has been a pretty nice thing to look forward to. gone are the days of being clutched by how many likes i didn&#39;t get on my last tiktok. i still check in on tiktok from time to time using my partner as a conduit (whom i talk about a lot (i just wanted the opportunity to link my posts about her ^_^))... but i dont really miss it outside of the discussions and smiles it brings us on a fairly irregular basis
...
anyways, i&#39;m rambling a bit. the reason i write today is because im starting to truly feel the effects of being a normal person. school is going remarkably well – with me finding a passion i want to pursue more than video game sound design – my social life isn&#39;t completely awful, and i have a bunch of fun trips lined up! i believe that as i get better at the things i do, i feel more supported by those around me because i am actively showing off what i can do. this is a novel thing to me! when i started college, i thought i was gonna end up composing or doing live shows, but that wasn&#39;t my groove. now that i&#39;ve found it (my groove) i truly feel like i contribute to the people around me.
...
on that note, i haven&#39;t teared up in a while... okay i&#39;m lying. i&#39;ve been playing the witness a bit and did NOT expect to be HIT by a FREIGHT train (don&#39;t worry, this is related). there&#39;s a woman who talks about the concept of aspiration and desire being a fundamental part of a person&#39;s sense of self, and how that&#39;s sometimes stunting to a person&#39;s happiness. i think that i don&#39;t need to tell myself what i want to do anymore, i just do it, which i why i&#39;ve been feeling a lot better lately. don&#39;t get me wrong – i still have a LOT of work to do on myself, but i think i&#39;m getting to one of the best places i&#39;ve been in my life (fingers crossed, knock on wood, salt over the shoulder, PLEASE beam luck to me).
...
anyways (again), i&#39;m just about done here. if you&#39;re still reading, id recommend you check out my rss feed for this blog. thank you for passing through, and i hope to see you in the next one, he shouts into the void.</p>
